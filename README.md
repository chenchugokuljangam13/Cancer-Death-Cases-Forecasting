# Cancer Mortality Prediction in India

## Project Overview
Cancer is a major cause of death in India, as it is globally. This research aims to predict cancer mortality in India using supervised machine learning methods. We utilize cancer mortality data from 1990 to 2017, categorized by age group, gender, and region, sourced from the Global Burden of Disease Study. Our goal is to provide long-term predictions that can aid the health department in developing strategies to combat cancer.

## Introduction
This project involves predicting cancer mortality in India using three supervised learning algorithms: linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression. After evaluating these models, we found that the random forest regression model performs the best.

## Data Description
We use cancer mortality data from the Global Burden of Disease Study, covering the years 1990 to 2017. The data is categorized by:
- Age group
- Gender
- Region
