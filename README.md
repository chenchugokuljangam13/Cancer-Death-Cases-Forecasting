## Introduction
This project Forecasts cancer death cases in India using three algorithms: 
linear regression
decision tree regression
random forest regression
We found the random forest model performs the best.

## Data Description
We use cancer death case data from the Global Burden of Disease Study, covering the years 1990 to 2017. The data is categorized by:
- Year
- Region
- Type of cancer
- Count of cases
